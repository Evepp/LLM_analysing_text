This repository is for a project aimed at collecting journal entries and developing tools using large language models (LLMs) to recognize patterns that can help measure certain personality differences and ways of thinking. The goal is to reduce biases in traditional in-person assestments, address self-deception, and overcome minimal self-disclosure.

The purpose of the journal entries is to encourage self-integration by prompting reflection on repressed emotions. While building this data collection, the approach will be grounded in the principles of depth psychology. One branch of the project will focus on gathering these entries, while another will apply depth psychology techniques to analyze existing data sources. 

However, the aim is to take two approaches of analysis: 
- Inductive reasoning for to collect data, or find trends of thought.
- Deductive reasoning research for theories in personality and differential psychological aspects from early philosophical concepts to the most recent public assetments. (This mapping is another project by its own, but aims to take the evolution of personality traits and ways of thought to recolect the theories and take from those).


First branch: 
The first objective is to identify personality traits, such as extroversion, openness, and others, through prompt-based questions while also collecting relevant data. The goal is to make these metrics more accessible by relating them to widely recognized systems like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Enneagram, which are familiar to the general public.



Second branch: 

Given the focus on applying depth psychology concepts to analyze repressed feelings and their connection to personality traits, one approach involves dream analysis. Databases:  [https://sleepanddreamdatabase.org/] [https://dreambank.net/].
With those datasets listed, currently only working in the analysis of dreams based on clustering and sentiment analysis.
