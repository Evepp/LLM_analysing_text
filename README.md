# LLM_analysing_text

This repository is for a project aimed at collecting journal entries and developing tools using large language models (LLMs) to recognize patterns that can help measure certain mental health disorders. The goal is to reduce biases in traditional in-person therapy, address self-deception, and overcome minimal self-disclosure.

The purpose of the journal entries is to encourage self-integration by prompting reflection on repressed emotions. While building this data collection, the approach will be grounded in the principles of depth psychology. One branch of the project will focus on gathering these entries, while another will apply depth psychology techniques to analyze existing data sources.


First branch: 
The first objective is to identify personality traits, such as extroversion, openness, and others, through prompt-based questions while also collecting relevant data. The goal is to make these metrics more accessible by relating them to widely recognized systems like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Enneagram, which are familiar to the general public.

The second objective focuses on analyzing mental health disorders by examining journal entries, using guidelines from the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) or similar mental health handbooks to inform the analysis.



Second branch: 

Given the focus on applying depth psychology concepts to analyze repressed feelings and their connection to mental health disorders, one approach involves dream analysis. Databases:  [https://sleepanddreamdatabase.org/] [https://dreambank.net/].
Given the datasets listed, currently only working in the analysis of dreams based on exploring the symbolic meaning of certain elements in greater depth, linking them to myths, fairy tales, and religious symbols following a Jungian approach.
