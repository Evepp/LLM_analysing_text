# LLM_analysing_text

The following is a repository for a project with the intention to collect journal entries as well as predict an develop LLM tools to recognize patters to meassure certain childhood disorders. Combating biases in in person therapy, self-deception, minimal self-disclosesure.

Next to correlate with other more specialized psychological test for personality traits. 
- This also with the intention to popularize to gather more collection of data.

Third scope will be to develop fully the LLM model based on the journal entries, optimizing, instead of a pre-trained model.
