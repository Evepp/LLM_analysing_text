# LLM_analysing_text

The following is a repository for a project with the intention to collect journal entries as well as predict an develop LLM tools to recognize patters to meassure certain childhood disorders. Combating biases in in person therapy, self-deception, minimal self-disclosesure. 
First scope is to identify personality traits such as extroversion, openesss and so on. Also popular ones, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,and Ennergram.
Next to correlate with other more specialized psychological test for personality traits. 
- This also with the intention to popularize to gather more collection of data.

Second scope comes with analyzing childhood disorders in analyzing entries, deployment of a pre trained LLM model at the beginning Claude 3 and testing giving its neutrality. Ideally will be to compare it with real results of chilhood disorders of past patients, but still to see. 
Third scope will be to develop fully the LLM model based on the journal entries, optimizing, instead of a pre-trained model.
